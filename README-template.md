## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- How to use React
- React file structure
- Deployment of React app
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- More React projects (familiarize myself w/ process and good practices of creating apps)
- Eventually learn backend stuff (start with simple JSON Server backend since it can be integrated right into React)

### Useful resources

- CSS Tricks
- W3Schools
- StackOverflow
- YouTube (Traversy Media)
