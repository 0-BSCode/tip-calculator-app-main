## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned this challenge was how to use React JS, a tool that I've been wanting to use to improve my front-end web dev skills. To learn it, I followed along with a YouTube tutorial by Traversy Media (Link is in the useful resources section). I also learned how to organize my files in a react app, since I had to find a way to include the assets provided by the challenge somehow. Thankfully, the assets can be easily inserted by placing all their folders in the `src` folder. Finally, I decided to use Heroku to deploy the app since I've also been wanting to use that tool as well. The resources I used to learn how to do so is placed in the useful resources section!

### Continued development

- More React projects (familiarize myself w/ process and good practices of creating apps)
- Eventually learn backend stuff (start with simple JSON Server backend since it can be integrated right into React)
